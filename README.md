# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose:
This data analysis is to identify key ride sharing metrics by city type and to create a graphical representation of the total weekly fares based on the city types which will help improve access to ride sharing services and determine ride affordability.

## Findings from performing the analysis:
-  The rural cities had the highest average fare per driver and ride while the urban cities had the lowest.
- The high fares observed in the rural cities was due to the low number of total rides and total drivers in those cities.
- The urban cities had the highest total fare within the months of January to April 2019 followed by the rural cities.
- The urban cities had the lowest fare and the low fares can be attributed to the empty cells observed in the rural cities column after arranging the data into the specified date range using the loc function. 

## Summary:
Urban city type continues to be the largest source of revenue for PyBer. There may be opportunity to capture more of the ride share market, if the underutilized drivers in the Urban cities can be moved to Urban areas. Rural city types are most lucrative for drivers on a per ride basis.
